description: Routine dependency hygiene for the-cycle — survey what's outdated, plan the bump, update, run the gates, and land one lockfile commit. Distinguishes a stale test expectation from a real regression. Never uses `audit fix --force`; never auto-pushes. Plan-first. Usage `/dep-update` (or `/dep-update <package>`).

# /dep-update — dependency hygiene

Goal: keep dependencies current without turning a routine bump into an outage.

**Shared rules in `.claude/skills/DOCTRINE.md` — read it if not already in context.** Leans on §4
(Gates), §8 (commit conventions — explicit paths), §9 (branch policy).

## Workflow

1. **Survey.** `npm outdated` and `npm audit`. Group by risk: patch/minor on a leaf dependency is
   routine; a **major**, a **framework**, or anything with a **native build step** is not.
2. **Present the plan** (a status update, not a gate — §5): what's bumping, from → to, which group
   each falls in, and anything you're deliberately holding back and why.
3. **Branch** (§9).
4. **Update.** `npm update` for the routine set; name specific packages for anything riskier.
   Take majors **one at a time** — a batch of majors makes a failure impossible to attribute.
5. **Watch the install output**, don't just check the exit code. A patch step that silently
   no-ops, a native module that rebuilds against a different ABI, or a postinstall that fails
   soft will all exit 0 and break at runtime.
6. **Advisories.** `npm audit fix` only if needed — **never a force
   flag.** Forcing an advisory fix installs semver-major changes; that's a different change than
   the one you're making, and it lands unreviewed. If only forcing would fix it, stop and surface
   the tradeoff.
7. **Run the gates** (§4):
   ```
   npm test
   ```
   **A red gate here is one of two things, and they need opposite responses:**
   - **A stale expectation** — the dependency legitimately changed its output, and the test
     encoded the old one. Update the test, and say so in the commit.
   - **A real regression** — the dependency broke something you rely on. Do **not** update the
     test to match. Pin back, and file it.

   If you can't tell which, that's a judgment call (§5) — surface it rather than guessing.
8. **Commit** (§8) — one commit, explicit paths (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, plus any test file a
   *stale expectation* legitimately required). Never `-A`.
9. **Report** what moved, what's held back and why, and gate status. **Don't auto-push** — a
   dependency bump lands on Brandon's schedule.

## Edge cases

- **Lockfile drift with nothing outdated:** `npm install` rewrote the lockfile without any
  version change (a transitive resolution moved). That's a legitimate standalone commit — say so, don't
  bury it in an unrelated diff.
- **A formatter or linter bumped** and now reformats files nobody touched: separate the
  reformat-everything commit from the version bump, or the diff is unreviewable.
- **A native or compiled dependency's ABI changed**: the gates may pass locally and fail on the
  deploy target, which runs a different runtime version. Call it out explicitly.
- **A patch/override is in play:** confirm it still applies after the bump. A silently-dropped
  patch is the classic "it worked locally" failure.
- **Nothing is outdated:** say so and stop. Don't manufacture a bump.
