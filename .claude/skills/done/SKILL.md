description: Ship a the-cycle story — commit the reviewed work, push, open a PR that Closes #<n>, and (for a safe story) merge it via the background poll-then-merge guard; a judgment-call story's PR is left for Brandon's manual merge. Done = the issue closes on merge. Plan-first. Usage `/done #<n>`. Use after /review (+ /patch) pass clean.

# /done #<n> — ship a story

Goal: commit the reviewed work, push, open a PR that closes the issue, and land it — auto-merging
a safe story (CI-gated, via the background guard) or leaving a judgment-call PR for
Brandon.

**Shared rules in `.claude/skills/DOCTRINE.md` — read it if not already in context.** This skill
leans on §4 Gates, §5 Judgment calls (the safe-vs-brake split), §6 Merge guard, §7 Tracker
mechanics, §8 Commit & PR conventions, §9 Branch policy. The procedure below is just the ordering.

**Done = the issue closes.** `Closes #<n>` closes it on merge (§1).

## Workflow

1. **Parse the issue ref(s)** — `#<n>`. Several only if one diff genuinely ships them together;
   usually one PR = one issue.
2. **Confirm gates green** (§4) — never `/done` over a red build:
   ```
   npm test
   ```
3. **Confirm findings were actioned, not parked** (§5) — `/patch` fixed every real finding, or
   each was an explicit escalation to a `finding` issue. Never a silent defer.
4. **Survey the diff** — `git status` + `git diff --stat`. Only expected files; flag drift.
5. **Branch check** (§9) — must be on a feature branch, not `main`. If on `main`, stop.
6. **Compose the narrative** — the "what shipped + which findings were actioned + why" summary
   that becomes the **PR body**.
7. **Commit** (§8) — Conventional Commit, explicit paths (never `-A` / `.`), the `Co-Authored-By`
   trailer, HEREDOC body.
8. **Push** — `git push -u origin <branch>`.
9. **Open the PR** (§8) — `node scripts/forgejo.mjs pr create --head "<branch>" --base main --title "<title>" --body "<body>"` — base `main`, the
   narrative body, **`Closes #<n>`**, the `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]…` line at the end, the
   Conventional-Commit subject as title.
10. **Post a one-line issue comment** linking the PR: `node scripts/forgejo.mjs issue comment "<n>" "<text>"`
11. **Land it — the auto-merge decision (§5 + §6):**
    - **Safe story** — none of §5's always-brake classes (auth / tokens / secrets, schema / data migration, anything destructive or irreversible) **and** green CI →
      run the **poll-then-merge guard in the background**:
      ```bash
      node scripts/forgejo-merge.mjs "<pr>" --closes "<n>" &
      ```
      After it lands, sync local main and prune the branch.
    - **Judgment-call story** → **leave the PR open**, report "ready for your merge: <url>" + *why*
      it's gated. Do NOT auto-merge.
12. **Suggest next:** `/deploy-test`, `/next`, or `/cycle` continues.

## Edge cases

- **Gates red / tests skipped:** STOP — don't paper over it.
- **CI red on the PR:** do NOT merge; surface the failing job (§6 — read the log, don't "retry and
  see"); fix on the branch, push, re-check.
- **Unrelated drift in the diff:** surface it; stage selectively (§8 — never `-A`).
- **The merge command is denied by the harness's own classifier** (§6): report the open, CI-pending
  PR and ask Brandon for a one-turn approval. That's an environment gate, not a §5 pause —
  don't retry with workarounds.
- **Whole epic done:** note it; suggest a docs shipped note if warranted — don't auto-restructure.
- **Issue didn't close after merge** (a `Closes #<n>` typo, or a non-default base): close it
  explicitly — `node scripts/forgejo.mjs issue close "<n>"`.
